In the meantime, here’s a poem:\nAs I was walking all alane, I heard twa corbies making a mane; The tane unto the t’other say, ‘Where sall we gang and dine to-day?’\n’In behint yon auld fail dyke, I wot there lies a new-slain knight; And naebody kens that he lies there, But his hawk, his hound, and his lady fair.\n’His hound is to the hunting gane, His hawk, to fetch the wild-fowl hame, His lady’s ta’en another mate, So we may mak our dinner sweet.\n‘Ye’ll sit on his white hause-bane, And I’ll pike out his bonny blue een. Wi’ ae lock o’ his gowden hair, We’ll theek our nest when it grows bare.\n‘Mony a ane for him makes mane, But nane sall ken whare he is gane: O’er his white banes, when they are bare, The wind sall blaw for evermair.’"
